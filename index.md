<b> About </b>
I am a PhD student in the Psychology Department at the University of California, Berkeley.

<b> Research Interests </b>
I currently explore two lines of research. The first line examines how emotion beliefs impact interpersonal dynamics. The second line examines the communicative features of emotions, specifically how emotions signal moral virtues and cultural norms around emotion displays.
